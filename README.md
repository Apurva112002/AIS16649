Task 1: A. variable selection rule:variable selection rule are use for naming variables correctly:Variable names can contain letters (a-z, A-Z), digits (0-9), and underscores (_),Variable names must begin with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_), Variable names are case-sensitive, so myVar and myvar would be considered different variables,Python keywords cannot be used as variable names, Variable names should be descriptive and meaningful to indicate the purpose of the variable ,Avoid using special characters like !, @, #, $, %, etc.
B.Python, operators are like little tools you can use to do different things with numbers and values. There are different types of operators:1}Arithmetic operators: in this operators are used with numeric value to perform a mathamatical operation like adding (+), subtracting (-), multiplying (), dividing (/), getting the remainder (%), and raising to a power (*).2}Comparison operators: YThis is use to comparision two value it's give an output in true or false equal (==), not equal (!=), greater than (>), less than (<), etc.3}Logical operators: This Operators are use to combine conditional Statmentse like "and", "or", and "not" words in Python. They help you combine conditions together.4}Python Identily Operators like is and is not 5}Python Membership Oprators(it use to test if seq is present in an object).
C.  There are different data types that you can use to store and work with different kinds of information. Here are some common data types in Python #List a)IT is a collection of Orderd b)IT is changable c)It take Dublicates d) IT is written in square bracket[] ##Tuple a)Tuples are multiple Value in a single Variables b)Tuples are Collection which is orderd c)IT unchangable allow dublicates c) written in () ## SET a)IS unorder b)Dublicate not allowed c)unchangable d)unindexed c)it written in curly bracket{} .##Dictionaries A) Dictionaries are used in key:value pairs B)IS in ordered C) Changeable D) DO not allow duplicates E)nit weritten in curly brackets.
