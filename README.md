Task 1: A. variable selection rule:variable selection rule are use for naming variables correctly:Variable names can contain letters (a-z, A-Z), digits (0-9), and underscores (_),Variable names must begin with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_), Variable names are case-sensitive, so myVar and myvar would be considered different variables,Python keywords cannot be used as variable names, Variable names should be descriptive and meaningful to indicate the purpose of the variable ,Avoid using special characters like !, @, #, $, %, etc.
B.Python, operators are like little tools you can use to do different things with numbers and values. There are different types of operators:1}Arithmetic operators: in this operators are used with numeric value to perform a mathamatical operation like adding (+), subtracting (-), multiplying (), dividing (/), getting the remainder (%), and raising to a power (*).2}Comparison operators: This is use to comparision two value it's give an output in true or false equal (==), not equal (!=), greater than (>), less than (<), etc.3}Logical operators: This Operators are use to combine conditional Statmentse like "and", "or", and "not" words in Python. They help you combine conditions together.4}Python Identily Operators like is and is not 5}Python Membership Oprators(it use to test if seq is present in an object).
C.There are different data types that you can use to store and work with different kinds of information. Here are some common data types in Python ##List a)IT is a collection of Orderd b)IT is changable c)It take Dublicates d) IT is written in square bracket[] ##Tuple a)Tuples are multiple Value in a single Variables b)Tuples are Collection which is orderd c)IT unchangable allow dublicates c) written in () ## SET a)IS unorder b)Dublicate not allowed c)unchangable d)unindexed c)it written in curly bracket{} .##Dictionaries A) Dictionaries are used in key:value pairs B)IS in ordered C) Changeable D) DO not allow duplicates E)it weritten in curly brackets.
Task 2: A}: IF-Statement in python use to make decisions it has a body of instructions that anly executes whenever the if statements condition is met.
B}If-Else conditions is written when the if statment is not true then we go to else statments to write a correct statments.C}If-elif condition is use to handle multiple conditions to check in short. elif keyword in python saying if the previous conditon were not true then try this condition.D}Forloop is use for making a sequence.its like a loop that goes through a list of things one by one.E}A while loop in python is type of loop that continues to execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.it repeatedly executes the code block untile the condition becomes false.
Task 3: A} Break Statement: Break statement in python is used to permaturely exit loop.when the break statment is encountered whithin a loop(for loop or while loop) the loop is immediately terminated and the program execution continues ith the next statement after the loop.B} Continuous statement:A continuous statement in python is when we want to write a long statementbut it too big to fit on one line.C}Pass statement:Pass statement in python like a placeholder that tells the computer to do nothing.its just to fill a space where python expects some code but you dont want to puth anything speacific.D}Statistical Functions: In the python the statistic module provides functions to perform statistical operations on data.This module offers various functions to calculate measures like mean,median,mode,standard deviation,variance,and more.D}Logical User definde function:a user defined function in python is custom function created by the usder to perform a specific task.
